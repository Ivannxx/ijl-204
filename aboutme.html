          <h2>ABOUT MYSELF</h2>
          <p>My name is Ivan Jade G. Lugo. I live in San Vicente, City of Ilagan, Isabela. I am 19 years old and I was born on October 20, 2002. I am an only child. I grew up with my Grandmother because my parents worked abroad. I studied elementary at
            Ilagan East Central School and I joined drum and lyre. I completed grade 7 to grade 12 at Isabela National High School. When I was 15 years old my mother returned to the Philippines. She is now a massage therapist and also sells snacks at the
            Xentro Mall. My Father is still working in Hong Kong so that he can provide for my needs and my education. My parents are not together but they are on good terms.
          <p>

          <p>I am currently studying at Isabela State University and the course I am taking is Bachelor of Science in Information Technology. My first 2 years in college were challenging because It was conducted online due to the COVID-19 virus. Because
            face-to-face is near, I'm happy because I can focus more especially on my studies and also having a new circle of friends.
          <p>

          <p>I am a kind, God-fearing, understanding, and loving person. I like watching anime, playing video games, and reading bible and manga stories. I love playing guitar and listening to music like OPM and Pop. I want to finish the housework first
            before I go out with my friends.
            I also play basketball, badminton and chess with my neighbor friends. I love to watch movies in cinemas, but sadly they are closed because of the pandemic that's why I'm watching on Television, Netflix, websites, and Bilibili. I also like to
            travel on road trips and shopping at the mall with my friends and families. My favorite food is adobo, beef steak, fried chicken and burger steak.
          <p>

          <p>I want to work hard so that I can achieve my dreams/ goals in life. I want to have my own house, car, business and help those in need. I want to finish school and find a good job so that I can help my parents and so that my dad does not have
            to work abroad. I am a respectful person, especially to elders. My grandmother always tells me that education is very important because it wonâ€™t steal anyone. Nobody is perfect just like me I have many weaknesses but it is not the barrier for
            me to aim to be a better person. Also, I am not afraid of failure because failure is not the opposite of success. It is part of success. The trials or challenges we experience in life are the way and can help us achieve what we hope for in
            life. For now, I want to stay focused on my goals, stay positively, stay strong, brave, dedicated, be patient and avoid any distractions.
