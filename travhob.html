          <p> Disneyland is my favorite place so far because it's my first time and I'm with my father. I toured everything there and my dream of coming here came true when I was young.

            <img class="images-guitar" src="images/guitar.jpg" alt="guitar" />
          <p> The benefits of playing the guitar are numerous, especially for your social life and mental health, making it a fantastic activity. In addition, I want to dazzle my loved ones.  <p>

            <img class="images-cod" src="images/cod.jpg" alt="cod" />
          <p> I play Call of Duty because the experts suggest that the fast-paced shooting game has advantages for practical learning because those who played it did better on a visual perception task. Previous video game study demonstrates that better
            visual training enhances the abilities required to be a proficient doctor or navigator.

            <br>
            <img class="images-bible" src="images/bible.jpg" alt="bible" />
          <p> There are many advantages to consistently and regularly reading the Bible. The Bible first reveals God's nature and his revelation of himself to his people. Every chapter of the Bible reveals something about God's holy, constant,
            dependable, gracious, and loving nature.
